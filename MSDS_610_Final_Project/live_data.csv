There is no rust ever-perfect floor pans and rockers,etc. There is a small rust hole directly below the battery +post and I will repair tomorrow..Very minor about 1"" round.. There is a new muffler installed... This car was painted with a medium quality paint job in the 90's and still looks good but i would expect it to be repainted properly with a better repair on the right rear fender,which is a poor repair of what was minor damage......An excellent driver just as it is... Transmission is flawless-shifts smooth and excellent synchros... Currently Registered and clear title.. I have experience shipping and will deliver this car to West Coast Shipping in Richmond CA. for $50... Shipping to most European ports is about $1300...",,ca,34.3308,-119.3584,2021-04-25T12:26:58-0700

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.
