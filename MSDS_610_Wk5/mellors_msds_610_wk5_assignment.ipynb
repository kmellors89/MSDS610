For critical success, I wanted to focus on my \"vote\" features. I wanted to specifically identify movies as critical success based on the number of votes and the vote rating.

In real world application, I would hope for a much larger dataset that would allow me to create stricter parameters, but for this project, I just wanted to showcase that I knew how to set the parameters and to clarify that I understand how I would tune them in the real world."

    "**Feature Justification:** This feature I actually added after I had already attempted to create my \"success score\" and this is because when I was considering my successes and how they would effect the score - through weight - I realized that for the purpose of my final project goal, that profitibility (financial success) would be the most important (and had to have more weight than the other successes). As such, I found that there was an extremely high correlation between my success score and my financial success, to the point where the other successes didn't really matter at all. I made a number of adjustments, but then realized that unless I treated all successes equally, it would be hard to create a broader correlation among all successes. To address this, I considered additional features, and I opted to create a weighted addition to the score, which is this new feature \"budget score\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature helps with distribution of successes to determine overall success (\"worth funding\") by creating a fourth and independent feature. This feature adds another element to the \"success score\" by praising lower budget movies - by adding a higher number to the success score - for being a lower risk (less loss for the production company if the movie fails, but easier to hit the ROI) and penalizing higher budget films for being higher risk and likely harder to achieve ROI. In this sense, profitability is still the most important, but now the other successes and the budget of the film have a better correlation to success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Much like the rest of this project, I did a lot of tuning and retuning. I opted to consider low budget films as under 10 million dollars and high budget films as over 50 million dollars. Additionally, I had to adjust and readjust the scores to try and find a good range to have films in all values."

    "This score uses a weighted system to generate a score (based off the binary scores of the 3 success types: financial, critical, and audience). However, since I am a film production company, and I am most interested in ROI, the financial success is the most important (meaning it needs to be weighted heavier than the other two) and then voting averages (critical success) and then audience success (popularity) would be the least, with the \"budget success\" helping to balance the utility of the three successes, so that profitability can still be the primary measurement without neglecting the rest of the important features. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Justification:** This feature is very important for my goal to finding is a movie is successful (worth funding), it takes into consideration 4 features that can be used to intepret success: the financial return on the film, how many people voted and how the voted the film, how popular the film is online (how much engagement the film has), and the risk of ROI based on the budget. This is not the final step in determining success -  nor is it my target feature, but it has direct correlation to my target feature \"worth funding\". The project up to this point has just been creating features and parameters to measure success, but doesn't tell us if the movie is worth funding, yet.\n",

    "Like the other aspects of this project, I had to adjust and readjust the weighted scores until I was able to find a happy \"medium\" that would give me a good distribution (note: even after a bunch of adjustments, I still had one dominating score: 2.25 w/ 1600). I don't have a particular justification for the exact numbers I used, aside from the fact that I did want financial success to be weighted highest, with critical success (votes averages and scores) being second, and audience success (hype) to be third. I kept them all withing .25 of eachother so that there wasn't a huge leap in weights, since I want them all to be taken into consideration."

    "**Note:** I recognize that I could have just created a \"fund\" if \"profitable\" recommender system, but since I needed to create more features, and I wanted to include other aspects in the data frame in the recommender system, I have generated a weighted score that takes into consideration the budget, the profitability, the critical success, and the popularity into the recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Justification:** This feature predicts, based on my parameters, if a film would have been worth funding, based on the success scores. This is the most important feature for my recommender system, because it is my target feature. I want to be able to determine if a movie is worth funding (by \"success score\" thresholds) based on provided textual data about a film that wants to be produced. This is different than recommending a new proposal, because that would rely on textual information, but before I can make the textual recommender, I need to identify which types of movies that investing in would have been worthwhile. Once I know what movies were worth funding, I can then build a recommender system that compares the textual data of successful movies to the textual data of the known movies to make a funding recommendation.\n",

    "- 2: Worth Funding - \"Success Score >= 2.5\"\n",
    "- 1: Consider Funding (Manual Decision) - \"Success Score >= 2.0\"\n",
    "- 0: Not Worth Funding - \"Success Score < 2.0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Again, I adjusted the thresholds for this feature to get a more even class balance. In the real world, I would fund way fewer movies than I would reject, but I wanted to address class imbalance, given the size of my dataset (~4,800 entries). Additionally, in the real world I would want a much larger dataset: like in the 100s of thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Below:** you can see the pearson correlation of the four variables to determine the \"success score\". As anticipated, with each lower level feature there is less, but still relevant, positive correlation. The financial success is still the highest determinate, as I wanted it to be. I decided to split the score as evenly as possible among the three \"worth funding\" recommender responses, to attempt to address class imbalance. The best I could come up with still had imbalance, but each category had an acceptable level of responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal Insight:** As I consider the success of my model and what I want it to accomplish, I am on the fence on if it would have been better to split the the recommendation into 2: fund or do not fund. I am opting to stick to the 3 responses - even though I would have a more even distribution of two - because I would imagine in the real world that there would be instances where the model wouldn't have enough information or have enough prediction power to address the ones that toe-the-line on whether or not to fund.

    "**Task Justification:** Here I want to check the correlation, through collinearity, of the relationships between my important features and target. I want to check for multicollinearity, because I want to make sure that the features are independent of each other, there is the possibility that there can be too high of a correlation between the features that I would need to drop one so that it doesn't effect the determination of success. I thought that this was important to do because there is a reasonable possibility that there can be a correlation between critical success and audience success (more hype might mean more voting and scoring). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** All of my features have VIF scores between (rounded) 2.0 to 2.4. Given that the closer to 1 the score is the least amount of collinearity exists, and that the higher it is (> 5.0) the more likely multicollinearity exists. These scores make me feel good, since they justify that the features are working independently of each other. "

    "**Task Justification:** I am aware that this task is likely not one where ML is necessary, because all predictions can be made using statistical analysis (which, from the lecture, is not the type of analytical question we want to ask). But, because I built the features and I do have a target for them - and so I can practice my ML models - I opted to include this model and its analytical question: \"Can I predict whether a movie will be successful based on finances, acclaim, and popularity?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this is still an important model when you consider that part of my scenario is that new films will continue to be added to the dataset, where there success_scores will need to be determined so that they can help grow the dataset and provide additional data for future fund proposal requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** As expected, the model performed with 100% accuracy, as it was able to determine the formulas used to predict the the \"success_score\". This ML model is likely unnecessary, but is a good example of why not every task needs to be done through ML. But, this would be a good AutoML to use to generate the \"success_scores\" for newly added films to the dataset.\n",

To address this I had to apply a sampling method, since using the \"class_weight=\"balanced\"\" function in the RF also did not result in any predictions for the minor class. So, I decided to apply this SMOTE sampling technique to even the number of samples for each variable. To make sure that I wasn't causing overfitting issues due to the synthetic data, I made sure to only apply SMOTE to the training data, so that the testing data maintains all real-world data.\n",

    "**Summary:** I developed an RF Classifier to see if a film could be determined to be worth funding based on text data alone. While I did build the model, addressed sampling issues, and raised my ML parameters to reasonably high levels, my model - after many, many runs - was barely able to perform better than a 3-sided cointoss, with a 57% accuracy rating. It performed the best at predicting \"do not fund\" (f1 = 0.67), and the worst at predicting \"do fund\" (0.03). This model did terrible at the specific task I was hoping to achieve, which - at the least - identify films worth investing in. \n",

    "**Important Note:** I have included Markdown text in each section that provides more indepth information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I looked to answer 2 analytical questions: one of them was a statistics-based question (not the end goal) and the other was a Machine Learning analytics question. The questions were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analytical Question 1 (Statistical Determination):** Can I predict whether a movie will be successful based on finances, acclaim, and popularity?\n",
    "- **Analytical Question 2 (True ML):** Can I predict whether a movie will be worth funding based on its textual information (genres, overview, keywords, tagline)?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer both of these questions, I had to develop new features, where both questions relied on the other. To answer the first question, I had to develop a feature that measures the success of a film (which I called \"success_score\"). To be able to answer this first question, I had to develop \"rules\" that dictate how to measure a films success, and this is what produced my new features. To measure success, given the data available to me, I decided to measure success based on 4 factors (disregarding my \"clean text\" features, which was necessary text clean up to answer my second question). My four new features that would be necessary to measure my final two features (\"success_score\" and \"worth_funding\") and the \"rules\" I set for them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"financial_success\": Profitability: Yes/No (1/0). 1 = the \"revenue\" of the movie was at least 2.5x the \"budget\" of the movie.\n",
    "- \"critical_success\": Voting Scores: Yes/No (1/0). 1 = the movie was rated at least \"6.0\" with over \"500\" votes.\n",
    "- \"audience_success\": Popularity: Yes/No (1/0). 1 = The movie's popularity is at least \"35\".\n",
    "- \"budget_score\": Reward for lower budget, penalty for higher budgets: Low/Medium/High (1.0/0.75/0.25). 1.0 = low budget, 0.25 = high budget\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** I explain in each section why I chose those parameters. In short, I had to find a happy medium given the small size of my data and a goal of finding as even of a class balance as I can. In real-world application I would hope for a much bigger dataset and would set tighter parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the 4 new features to measure the success of a film, I had to decide how I would answer that question. Since I used binary for my \"successes\" and a float for my \"budget_score\", I thought that I would create a scoring equation that would measure the score, where the higher the score the more \"successes\" the film meets: with the highest score of \"4\" being that it met the qualifications for all 3 \"successes\" (1,1,1) and had a low budget (1); and the lowest score of \"0.25\" being that it did not meet any of the 3 \"successes\" (0,0,0) and had a high budget (0.25), with a mix of other scores in between. This \"success_score\" will be used to answer my 2nd analytical question. I also provided \"weighted\" values for the three \"successes\", because I wanted to make sure that \"financial_success\" was the highest considered \"success\", without it having a direct correlation between \"financial_success\" and \"success_score\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After I created my \"success\" features and \"success_score\" I created a RF model to test if it could predict the \"success_score\", since the success score is just an statistical equation, I wanted to see if the RF model would be able to interpret the equation and show that it could implement it successfully. It did, as anticipated, score a perfect 100% accuracy -- as expected because this is a statistical analytical question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I have created my \"success_score\" I can now answer my second analytical question (the end-goal) that requires ML intervention. To do this, I created another feature called \"worth_funding\" that divided up the \"success_scores\" (from high to low) into 3 sections: \"fund\" (2), \"manual decision\" (1), \"do not fund\"(0). With this new \"worth_funding\" I wanted to test to see if a movie is worth funding (successful) based off the text-based information (overview, tagline, keywords, genres). I had to address class imbalance, due to a very low number of films listed as \"fund\", so I used SMOTE. I also continually raised my parameters to allow for more computation, leading to longer processing times, and unfortunately, the model barely performed better than a guess, with a 56% accuracy, and did terrible at predicting \"fund\" (2), which is not acceptable, because, at a minimum, I would want the model to predict movies worth funding the best. I would not recommend this model. And, I am not sure what I could do to improve it - other than what I did to address sampling and parameter tuning. There is a possibility that I messed something up or that this kind of recommender system is better suited for a different model, like deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note: I created a copy of this and notebook and decided to run the RF model, but this time with only 2 balanced \"worth_funding\" variables\" \"fund\", \"do not fund\" and ran the model again, and while it did perform better than this model, it still only did 60% accuracy with f-scores of 0.64 and 0.55. So, the issue is not the likely class distribution, but rather something else either related to how I processed the data or this is not a preferred model for this analytical question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of my model I did run a Classification Report to look at the statistics (discussed above) and looked at Most Important Feature: Words and Most Important Feature: Features. Noting that my model barely did better than guessing, I still wanted to showcase my ability to look at these performance matrices. For the most important words I looked at the top 10 words that had the highest correlation to \"worth_funding\" decisions, and found that all the words had weak correlation, with the top word being \"included\" with a score of \"0.014\" (closer to 1 the more important it is). The most important words had very little impact on decisionmaking. After that I did the most important features, which had these scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Genres: 0.031981\n",
    "- Keywords: 0.294262\n",
    "- Tagline: 0.088429\n",
    "- Overview: 0.585329\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that \"Overview\" (58.5%) was the highest predicator for prediction and \"Keywords\" was second with 29.4%. \"Genre\" (3.2%) and \"Tagline\" (8.8%) had very little effect on successful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verdict:** I would not recommend this system for practical use, while the statistics and feature engineering went well (and I actually enjoyed), the model performed poorly (barely above a guess) for actually determining if a film is worth funding based on text data. This might be better suited for a different type of model."
